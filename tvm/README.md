# Threaded Virtual Machine Solidity HTLC

"HTLCForwarder" contract is a robust implementation designed for the TVM (Threaded Virtual Machine) that utilizes the
unique features of 'asyncronous' blockchain architecture to manage Hashed Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs) for
[TIP3](https://github.com/broxus/tip3) token transfers.

### Supported Networks:

- Everscale and Venom
- The Open Network (expected to be compatible as for Aug 2024)

### Contract Workflow:

The forwarder handles only one transaction at a time, this contract can reset its state after each operation,
allowing for consecutive transactions without the need to deploy a new contract each time.

Major steps include:

1. **Initialization**: Setup is done via the constructor where the initial state is configured, and token wallet
   deployment is initiated if necessary.
2. **Routing HTLCs**: The `route` function sets up the HTLC, specifying details such as the counterparty, amount,
   hashlock, and timelock. It caters exclusively to outgoing transfers, capturing funds and preparing them for conditional
   release.
3. **Settlement**: Upon presenting the correct preimage that satisfies the hashlock, the `settle` function releases the
   funds to the appropriate party—either retaining them within the contract for incoming transfers or sending them out for
   outgoing transfers.
4. **Refunding**: If the timelock expires without the condition being met, the `refund` function returns the funds to
   the initiator, ensuring that tokens are not permanently locked.
5. **State Resetting**: After each transaction, `resetContractState` is called to clear the current operational
   parameters, making the contract ready for the next transaction.

### TIP3 Contract Callback

The `onAcceptTokensTransfer` function serves as a callback mechanism in TVM's blockchain ecosystems, specifically
designed to interact with TIP3 token contracts. It is invoked by a TIP3 token contract after a token transfer has been a
pproved and executed, facilitating post-transfer operations within the contract that defines this callback.

Here's a detailed explanation of how this function operates and its role within the broader contract architecture:

The function updates internal states setting a contract into 'routing' mode. This function is not called directly by
users or other contracts in a straightforward manner. Instead, it is automatically invoked by a TIP3 token contract once
a transfer of tokens to the callback-implementing contract is completed successfully.

The `onAcceptTokensTransfer` receives several parameters that provide context about the transfer, including:

- `tokenRoot`: The address of the token root contract, identifying the specific type of token involved in the transfer.
- `amount`: The amount of tokens transferred.
- `sender`: The address from which the tokens were sent.
- `senderWallet`: The specific wallet address that initiated the token transfer.
- `remainingGasTo`: The address intended to receive any remaining gas left over from the transaction.
- `payload`: A TvmCell containing additional data or instructions that may affect the logic executed by the callback.

The Modifier `onlyOurWallet` ensures that the `onAcceptTokensTransfer` callback function is only executed under secure
and expected conditions. Here's how it works:

```solidity
modifier onlyOurWallet() {
    require(tokenWallet_.value != 0 && msg.sender == tokenWallet_, HTLCErrors.INVALID_TOKEN_WALLET);
    _;
}
```

This is critical for maintaining control over who can trigger the callback and under what circumstances it can be
invoked. It checks:

1.  **Non-zero Wallet Address**: It first checks if `tokenWallet_` is not zero, which ensures that the wallet address is
    set before the function proceeds. This prevents the function from being called before the contract is fully initialized
    or in a reset state.
2.  **Correct Caller**: It verifies that `msg.sender` is equal to `tokenWallet_`, meaning the function call must come
    from the contract’s designated token wallet. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized calls from other
    addresses that might attempt to manipulate the contract’s state or trigger functions maliciously.

If either of the conditions fails, it throws an error with the message `HTLCErrors.INVALID_TOKEN_WALLET`, which helps
in debugging and understanding why a function call was rejected.

To set the Forwarder into 'routing' state, the contract verifies incoming payload:

1. The function first checks if the length of the incoming payload (`payloadSlice.bits()`) is exactly 588 bits. This
   specific check ensures that the payload format matches expected parameters and aligns with predefined data structures.
2. After confirming the payload length, the function decodes the payload to extract a boolean (`incoming`) and an
   address (`counterparty`). The contract then checks if `hashlock_` is `0x0`, which indicates that no current HTLC is
   active, and the contract is ready to accept a new HTLC setup:

- If the contract is ready, it proceeds to decode additional parameters from the payload (`hashlock` and `timelock`)
  and sets these along with the amount and counterparty to establish a new HTLC.
- It also ensures that the `timelock` is set for a future time (`timelock > now`), adding a temporal constraint to the
  HTLC.

If the contract is currently in a locked state (`hashlock_` is not `0x0`), indicating that another HTLC is active, the
function does not allow new setups or modifications. Instead, it attempts to refund the incoming tokens back to the
sender to prevent unintentional locking of funds under incorrect conditions. An error (`HTLCErrors.IN_SETTLEMENT_PHASE`)
is thrown to indicate that the contract is already engaged in another transaction.
